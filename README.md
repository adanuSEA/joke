A conceptual model outlines the relationships and connections between key variables in a study. For the economic contributions of agro-processing firms to food utilization and household income in Lafia, Nasarawa State, Nigeria, a conceptual model can be constructed with the following components:
1. Independent Variable: Agro-Processing Economic Contributions:
i.This variable represents the primary focus of the study, encompassing the economic contributions of agro-processing firms. It includes indicators such as job creation, income generation, and overall economic growth within the local community.
2. Mediating Variables: Market Dynamics and Technological Adoption:
i.Market Dynamics: This mediating variable reflects the linkages between the economic contributions of agro-processing firms and the market. It encompasses factors influencing market access, both domestically and internationally. The hypothesis is that favorable market dynamics positively mediate the economic contributions, creating opportunities for increased revenue and growth.
ii.Technological Adoption: Another mediating variable is technological adoption within agro-processing firms. This refers to the use of modern processing methods, machinery, and information and communication technologies (ICTs). The hypothesis is that advanced technology adoption enhances efficiency, quality, and overall competitiveness, thereby positively mediating economic contributions.
